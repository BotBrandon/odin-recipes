            <p><h3>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</h3></p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>ground beef,</li>
                <li>bell peppers,</li>
                <li>onions,</li>
                <li>combo of tomato sauce,</li>
                <li>tomato paste and crushed tomatoes,</li>
                <li>ricotta,</li>
                <li>shredded mozzarella,</li>
                <li>parmesan.</li>
            
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</p></li>

                <li><p>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</p></li>

                <li><p>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</p></li>

                <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>

            </ol>
