        <h2>How to Make Sweet and Sour Chicken</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325˚F. Cut chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place 1 cup cornstarch into a gallon-sized ziploc bag, add chicken and toss to coat (go on, toss it up, just make sure the bag is closed; that part is important).</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large, heavy bottom pot. </li>
            <li>In a shallow dish, whisk together 3 eggs. Dip the cornstarch-dredged chicken pieces into the beaten egg, coating both sides then transfer the chicken to the very hot oil.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken in hot oil about 30 seconds per side or until golden. Having very hot oil is key. You don't want to cook the chicken through, but just until golden. Transfer chicken to a 9x13 baking dish and continue dipping and sautéing remaining chicken, adding more oil as necessary.</li>
            <li>In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the sauce ingredients: 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, 4 Tbsp ketchup, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, 3/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp garlic salt.</li>
            <li>Pour sauce over your sauteed chicken pieces and toss to coat. Bake uncovered at 325˚F for 1 hour, turning the chicken twice while baking to coat with sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve warm or hot over steamy white rice, and crisp tender broccoli for a balanced meal.</li>
